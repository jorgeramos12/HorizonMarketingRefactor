## User Story

```
AS A marketing agency
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines
```


## Challenge Purpose
When a user arrives at a webpage that satisfies accessibility standards, I look at the source code and see semantic HTML elements. I look at the structure of the HTML elements and see that the components follow a logical structure independent of style and placement. I look at the icon and image elements and see accessible alt attributes. I look at the heading attributes and see that they fall in sequential order. When I look at the title element, I see that the title element is accessible.
